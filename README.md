# Bankruptcy Prevention Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a company will go bankrupt based on various financial and operational risk factors. It uses machine learning techniques to analyze company data and build a predictive model that can help businesses identify bankruptcy risk early.

## Objective
- Build a binary classification model to predict bankruptcy (Yes/No).
- Use financial and operational risk features for accurate prediction.
- Deploy the model via an interactive web app for easy use.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains 250 companies with 7 features related to:
  - Industrial Risk
  - Management Risk
  - Financial Flexibility
  - Credibility
  - Competitiveness
  - Operating Risk
  - Bankruptcy status (target variable)

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation and validation
- Deployment using Streamlit for real-time prediction

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
